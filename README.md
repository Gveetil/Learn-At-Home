## Technical Features

### MERN Stack
This application is developed using the MERN stack- It uses React and Material UI for the front end; The backend is powered by Node.js with express server, MySQL as the database, and sequelize as the ORM. 

### Dropbox
All files in the application are uploaded to dropbox, and downloaded on request thereafter. I have used the dropbox API for this. 
We need to use third party file storage because this applicaion is deployed on Heroku, which uses an ephemeral filesystem (i.e. uploaded files get deleted when the application is shut down or restarted). There are other paid integration options available, but for the current demonstration dropbox is a simple solution. 

### User Authentication and Security
Learn@Home uses express-session and passport middlewares for maintaining user sessions and authenticating user requests. Additionally, all passwords in the system are hashed using bcryptjs before being persisted. This security feature prevents any person with access to the database from being able to view or use the passwords of users in the system. 

### Responsive Web Design 
This application is built using Responsive web design principles. To achieve this, I have used the Material UI component library with styling to ensure pages render on all screen sizes.

## Usage Guidelines
